Cisco VPN:
cd (the extracted file directory)/vpn
sudo ./vpn_install.sh

Cisco AnyConnect VPN:
So apparently the anyconnect config file goes in /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile/ and the certs go in /opt/.cisco/certificates/ca/.

Installing Certs Not CA:
Create folder under:
/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/becrypt

dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

update-ca-certificates --verbose

update-ca-certificates --fresh
